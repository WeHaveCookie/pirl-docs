You will need to choose a beneficiary, fill the tip reason (why council shoud accept this tips request) then a tips value.

> The final value of the tip is decided based on the median of all tips issued by the tippers (council members).

> Tip will enter a closing phase when more than a half plus one of the council have endorsed a tip.
> So it should be done with justified reason.

When the 7th council member voted, a 24 hours countdown does start, then when this is over, a council member
need to close the tip.
