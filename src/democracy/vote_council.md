Hey fellows ! In this guide, you will see how to cast your vote for nominate council member

It's pretty straigthforward but I think it's important to do a note on this, cause it's an important process in PIRL 2.0

All proposals and treasury tips are submitted to the vote of the council. They have the power to improve the network. So i'ts important to cast your vote and choose wisely.

Go on [council page](https://explorer.pirl.network/#/council)
